  <!--
      This policy performs user authentication, in support of the
      password grant_type for OAuth2.0.

      Normally authentication would be done by calling out to an external service,
      like an LDAP datastore, or something else.

      Just for demonstration purposes, this policy does "local" user
      authentication against a list of usernames and passwords
      stored in the Javascript code. Never do this in production.
